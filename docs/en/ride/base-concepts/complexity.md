# Script complexity

**Script complexity** is a dimensionless quantity that estimates computational resources needed to execute a script.

The complexity of a script is estimated based on complexities of all the operators and functions it consists of. The complexity of the built-in functions is listed in the [Built-in functions](/en/ride/functions/built-in-functions/) article.

Limitations on script complexity are given in the [Limitations](/en/ride/limits/) article.

The complexity of a script can be seen in [Waves IDE](https://waves-ide.com):
