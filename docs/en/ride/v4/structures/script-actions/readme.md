# [Ride v4 and v3] Script actions

:warning: This is the documentation for the Standard library version 4 and 3. We recommend to use version 5. [Go to version 5](/en/ride/structures/script-actions/)

Script actions are executed, that is, they make changes on the blockchain only if they are included in the resulting expression of the callable function. See more details in the [Callable function](/en/ride/v4/functions/callable-function) article.
