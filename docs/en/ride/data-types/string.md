# String

`String` is a string data type.

Strings are [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) encoded.

## Limitations

The maximum size of a `String` variable is:

* For [Standard library](/en/ride/script/standard-library) version 3: 32,767 characters.
* For Standard library version 4: 32,767 **bytes** (1 character can take up to 4 bytes).

> :warning: Standard library version 4 becomes available since node version 1.2.0, after activation of feature #15 “Ride V4, VRF, Protobuf, Failed transactions”. Versions 1.2.x are currently available on [Stagenet](/en/blockchain/blockchain-network/) only.
