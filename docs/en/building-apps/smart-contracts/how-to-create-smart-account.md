        1. Type in [seed](/en/blockchain/waves-protocol/cryptographic-practical-details#creating-a-private-key-from-a-seed) in the **Seed phrase** field.
        2. Come up with an account name and enter it in the **Account name** field.
        3. Click **Import**.
    - If you don't have an account yet, click **Generate new account** in the drop-down list. As a result, the following account attributes will be displayed
        - account [address](/en/blockchain/account/address)
        - public key
