# Developer guide

Waves provides client libraries to work with the blockchain from your applications.

Also, you can create decentralized applications (dApps) on the blockchain using [Ride](/en/ride/) language. The dApps functions can be called from applications using client libraries.

## Client libraries

Send transactions and read blockchain data from your applications on Python, Java, C#, Swift, Kotlin.

See the list of supported programming languages on the [Client libraries](/en/building-apps/waves-api-and-sdk/client-libraries/) page.

## Development of decentralised applications

Start creating decentralised applications following the steps:

- View the Ride language [presentation](https://wavesprotocol.org/protocol/ride) on the official product page.
- Learn the language syntax in the [introductory article](/en/ride/getting-started). Take a look at the [examples](https://github.com/wavesplatform/ride-examples) of Ride scripts.
- The process of developing a decentralized application is explained in the article [How to Build, Deploy and Test a Waves Ride dApp](https://medium.com/wavesprotocol/how-to-build-deploy-and-test-a-waves-ride-dapp-785311f58c2) on Medium. A step-by-step example of creating a simple dApp is shown on the page [Simple voting of the Waves blockchain](/en/building-apps/smart-contracts/simple-voting-on-the-waves-blockchain).
- To learn more about Ride and the infrastructure for creating decentralised applications, take the [Mastering Web3 with Waves](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mastering-web3-waves) course. After completing the course, you will receive a certificate of successful completion of the course.

## Tools for programming in Ride

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Ride](https://github.com/wavesplatform/ride-vscode) plugin
- [Waves IDE](https://waves-ide.com/) — online application for developing and deploying applications on the blockchain.
- [Surfboard](https://github.com/wavesplatform/Surfboard) — command-line interface for testing and deploying applications on the blockchain.
