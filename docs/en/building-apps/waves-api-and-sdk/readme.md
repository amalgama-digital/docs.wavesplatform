# Waves API

The following APIs are available to interact with Waves blockchain:

* [Waves Node REST API](/en/waves-node/node-api/) (described in “Node” chapter) provides the node interface for sending transactions and using some utils.
* [Waves Data service API](/en/building-apps/waves-api-and-sdk/waves-data-service-api) aimed at retrieving data from blockchain.
* [Waves Keeper API](/en/ecosystem/waves-keeper/waves-keeper-api) allows web services to interact with user accounts if their browser has Waves Keeper installed.

Client SDKs are available on the [Client Libraries](/en/building-apps/waves-api-and-sdk/client-libraries/) page.
