# Generator's Income

The **mining** is the [generation](/en/blockchain/block/block-generation/) of blocks by [mining node](/en/blockchain/node/mining-node).

For generating blocks, [miners](/en/blockchain/mining/miner) receive a [mining reward](/en/blockchain/mining/mining-reward), as well as [transaction fees](/en/blockchain/transaction/transaction-fee), according to the [Waves-NG protocol](/en/blockchain/waves-protocol/waves-ng-protocol) rules.
