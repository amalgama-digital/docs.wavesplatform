# Why Waves

Waves is an open blockchain protocol and development toolset for Web 3.0 applications and decentralized solutions.

## Tokenization

Issuing your own token on the Waves blockchain is a piece of cake. The token is available for transfers and trading immediately: that's perfect for crowdfunding and ICO. [More about token issue](/en/building-apps/how-to/assets/issue)

## Smart Сontracts

Waves offers a unique approach to decentralized application development: by avoiding gas and non-Turing-complete language we keep the system secure and predictable. For smart contract creation, Waves provides its native language called Ride. Its straightforward and developer-friendly syntax makes blockchain development easy and intuitive. [More about Ride](/en/ride/getting-started)

## Leased Proof of Stake

Waves is based on a Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm. Each participant's chance to generate the next block is proportional to their economic stake in the network. Unlike Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake is hardware-savvy and power-savvy, making attacks profitless for miners.

Users can lease their WAVES to a Waves node and get a part of the node payout as a reward, preserving full control over their WAVES under their accounts. [More about leasing](/en/blockchain/leasing)

## Performance

The Waves-NG protocol boosts blockchain performance to hundreds of transactions per second by using “liquid” blocks that grow continuously until the next block is created. It usually takes about 2 seconds to add a transaction to the block, which contributes to user experience of your apps. [More about Waves-NG](/en/blockchain/waves-protocol/waves-ng-protocol)

## Transparency

The Waves protocol is totally open, with the source code [available on Github](https://github.com/wavesplatform). The protocol's updates and improvements are discussed by the community on the [Waves Enhancement Proposals](https://forum.wavesplatform.com/c/waves-improvment-proposals) forum. [Activation of new features](/en/waves-node/features/) and [reward changes](/en/blockchain/mining/mining-reward) are accepted by voting of the nodes.

## Ecosystem for Developers

Beyond the blockchain functionality and its underlying protocols, the Waves ecosystem offers a diverse collection of tools, products, and components to streamline the process of building and running dApps. The tools are developed both by the Waves team and the developer community.

<!-- ## Sponsoring

Application developers can pay fees for dApp script calls of their users and decrease the entry threshold for them (for example, offer a free trial). [More] (/ en/blockchain/waves-protocol/sponsored-fee) -->
