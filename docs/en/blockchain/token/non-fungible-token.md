# Non-fungible token

**Non-fungible token** or **NFT** is a special type of a [token](/en/blockchain/token/) that is issued with the following parameters:

* `"quantity": 1`
* `"decimals": 0`
* `"reissuable": false`

NFT is a singular entity that has a unique ID. This contrasts with a regular token, two coins of which (for example, two [WBTC](https://wavesexplorer.com/assets/8LQW8f7P5d5PZM7GtZEBgaqRPGSzS3DfPuiXrURJ4AJS)) cannot be distinguished from each other. NFTs can be used as in-game items, collectibles, certificates, or unique coupons.

## Issue of NFT

NFT can be issued in the same ways as a regular token, see [Token Issue](/en/blockchain/token/#issue-token). The minimum fee for an NFT issue is 0.001 WAVES, 1000 times less than for a regular token.
