# Mass Transfer Transaction Binary Format

> Learn more about [mass transfer transaction](/en/blockchain/transaction-type/mass-transfer-transaction).

## Version 2

Binary format of version 2 is defined in [transaction.proto](https://github.com/wavesplatform/protobuf-schemas/blob/master/proto/waves/transaction.proto) protobuf scheme. The fields that are common to all types of transactions are described in the [Transaction Binary Format](/en/blockchain/binary-format/transaction-binary-format/) article.

Version 2 is added in node version 1.2.0 and becomes available after activation of feature #15 “Ride V4, VRF, Protobuf, Failed transactions”. Versions 1.2.x are currently available on [Stagenet](/en/blockchain/blockchain-network/) only.

| Field | Size | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| asset_id | 32 bytes | ID of token to transfer |
| transfers.recipient.public_key_hash | 20 bytes | Recipient's account public key hash (a component of an address, see the [Address binary format](/en/blockchain/binary-format/address-binary-format) article) |
| transfers.recipient.alias | From 4 to 30 bytes | Recipient's [alias](/en/blockchain/account/alias) |
| transfers.amount | 8 bytes | Amount of token to transfer, specified in the minimum fraction (“cents”) |
| attachment | Up to 140 bytes | Arbitrary data (typically a comment to transfer) |

The maximim number of transfers is 100.
