# Transfer Transaction Binary Format

> Learn more about [transfer transaction](/en/blockchain/transaction-type/transfer-transaction).

## Version 3

Binary format of version 3 is defined in [transaction.proto](https://github.com/wavesplatform/protobuf-schemas/blob/master/proto/waves/transaction.proto) protobuf scheme. The fields that are common to all types of transactions are described in the [Transaction Binary Format](/en/blockchain/binary-format/transaction-binary-format/) article.

Version 3 is added in node version 1.2.0 and becomes available after activation of feature #15 “Ride V4, VRF, Protobuf, Failed transactions”. Versions 1.2.x are currently available on [Stagenet](/en/blockchain/blockchain-network/) only.

        bytes public_key_hash = 1;
        string alias = 2;
    };

| Field | Size | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| recipient.public_key_hash | 20 bytes | Recipient's account public key hash (a component of an address, see the [Address binary format](/en/blockchain/binary-format/address-binary-format) article) |
| recipient.alias | From 4 to 30 bytes | Recipient's [alias](/en/blockchain/account/alias) |
| amount.asset_id |32 bytes | ID of token to transfer |
| amount.amount | 8 bytes | Amount of token to transfer, specified in the minimum fraction (“cents”) |
| attachment | Up to 140 bytes | Arbitrary data (typically a comment to transfer) |

## JSON Representation of Transaction

See the [example](https://nodes.wavesnodes.com/transactions/info/2UMEGNXwiRzyGykG8voDgxnwHA7w5aX5gmxdcf9DZZjL) in Node API. In the JSON representation, values of `feeAsset` and `feeAssetId` fields are identical.
