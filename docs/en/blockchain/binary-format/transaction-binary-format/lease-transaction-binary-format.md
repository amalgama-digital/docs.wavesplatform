# Lease Transaction Binary Format

> Learn more about [Lease transaction](/en/blockchain/transaction-type/lease-transaction).

## Version 3

Binary format of version 3 is defined in [transaction.proto](https://github.com/wavesplatform/protobuf-schemas/blob/master/proto/waves/transaction.proto) protobuf scheme. The fields that are common to all types of transactions are described in the [Transaction Binary Format](/en/blockchain/binary-format/transaction-binary-format/) article.

Version 3 is enabled by feature #15 “Ride V4, VRF, Protobuf, Failed transactions”.

```
message LeaseTransactionData {
     Recipient recipient = 1;
     int64 amount = 2;
};

message Recipient {
    oneof recipient {
        bytes public_key_hash = 1;
        string alias = 2;
    };
};
```

| Field | Size | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| recipient.public_key_hash | 20 bytes | Recipient's account public key hash (a component of an address, see the [Address binary format](/en/blockchain/binary-format/address-binary-format) article) |
| recipient.alias | From 4 to 30 bytes | Recipient's [alias](/en/blockchain/account/alias) |
| amount | 8 bytes | Amount of WAVELETs to lease (that is, amount of WAVES multiplied by 10<sup>8</sup>) |

## Version 2

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Version flag |  | [Byte](/en/blockchain/blockchain/blockchain-data-types) | 1 | Indicates the transaction version is 2 or higher.<br>Value must be 0 |

| **3** | Transaction version | version | [Byte](/en/blockchain/blockchain/blockchain-data-types) | 1 | Value must be 2 |
| **4** | Reserved field | | [Byte](/en/blockchain/blockchain/blockchain-data-types) | 1 | Value must be equal to 0 |

In this case 8 <= `S` <= 34 |
| **7** | Amount of [WAVES](/en/blockchain/token/waves) that will be leased to the [account](/en/blockchain/account/) | amount | [Long](/en/blockchain/blockchain/blockchain-data-types) | 8 | |

| **9** | Transaction timestamp | timestamp | [Long](/en/blockchain/blockchain/blockchain-data-types) | 8 | |
| 10 | [Transaction proofs](/en/blockchain/transaction/transaction-proof) | proofs | See [Transaction Proofs Binary Format](/en/blockchain/binary-format/transaction-proof-binary-format) | `S` | If the array is empty, then `S` = 3. <br>If the array is not empty, then `S` = 3 + 2 × `N` + 64 × `N`, where `N` is the number of proofs in the array.<br>The maximum number of proofs in the array is 8. The size of each proof is 64 bytes |

> The fields numbered in bold are the transaction body bytes.
