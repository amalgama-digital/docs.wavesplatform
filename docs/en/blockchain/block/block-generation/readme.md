# Block generation

A **block generation** is a creation of a new [block](/en/blockchain/block/) on the [blockchain](/en/blockchain/blockchain/).

Blocks are generated by [generating nodes](/en/blockchain/node/mining-node) according to [FPoS](/en/blockchain/waves-protocol/fair-pos) algorithm and the [Waves-NG protocol](/en/blockchain/waves-protocol/waves-ng-protocol).

The block generator signs the block headers only. The block headers contain the Merkle Root Hash of the block transactions. This makes possible to verify the block headers apart from transactions and to provide evidence of the presence of transactions in the block without the presence of all transactions. See details in the [Transactions Root Hash](/en/blockchain/block/merkle-root) article. (Before activation of feature #15 “Ride V4, VRF, Protobuf, Failed transactions”, block headers did  not contain the transaction root hash, and the block generator signed the bytes of block headers along with all transactions.)
