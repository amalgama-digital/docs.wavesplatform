# Extensions

A **node extension** is a software module that can be installed on a [node](/en/blockchain/node/).

Available extensions:

* [gRPC Server](/en/waves-node/extensions/grpc-server/) provides information about accounts, tokens, blocks, transactions and other data.
* [Blockchain Updates](/en/waves-node/extensions/blockchain-updates) enables tracking changes made by each transaction and block.
* [Matcher](https://github.com/wavesplatform/matcher) is a bridge between the node and the matcher server.
